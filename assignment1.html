                Assignment 1
            </h1>
            <p>
                A little about myself is I am a current senior at Kennesaw State University
                graduating at the end of this semester with a degree in Information Technology and concentration on mobile and web
                development. The course this website is for is IT4213 Mobile and web development and
                <a href="http://it4213.azurewebsites.net/">here</a> is the azure page with more information.


            </p>
            <h1>1) Mobile device properties</h1>
            <p>
            Brand/model: IPhone X | Chipset:  Apples A11 (six core processor) | Screen Size: 5.8" | Native Resolution: 320x693
             | CSS viewport resolution: 375x812 | Mobile Brower Type and version: Safari v 14.0

            </p>
            <h1>2)Describe what a viewport is and how it affects web pages in mobile browsers</h1>
            <p>
                A viewport to the best of my knowledge is what is being viewed by the current user looking at the webpage. If you were to not
                specify a mobile view port for the page you were building it would just end up showing the screen as it would on a computer very zoomed out and not handcrafter to have information
                front and center for different devices screens.

            </p>
            <h1>2.1) </h1>
            <p>
                The problem with the page demo for this assignment is that it doesnt seem like any viewport width was set for this so there is   
                extra space on the sides which is very unappealing as well as viewport height nothing was set so we are seeing exactly what the web page
                was intended to look like on a normal browser this exactly what was described in the previous assignment.
